# Resful API
### What is your project?

I'm building an RESTful API for an uptime monitoring application, without using NPM modules, dependencies.
Only using Node modules.

UPTIME MONITOR: allows users to enter URLs they want monitored, and receive alerts when those resorces GO Down o COME BACK UP.

## Requirements:

1. The API listens on a PORT and accepts incoming HTTP requests for POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD.
